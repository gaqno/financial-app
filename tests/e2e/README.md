# E2E Test Suite - Financial Application

## Overview

This comprehensive E2E test suite covers all the scenarios tested during our manual Playwright MCP session, including the bugs we discovered and fixed. The tests are organized into focused suites that validate specific functionality areas.

## Test Files Structure

### 1. `comprehensive-crud-flows.spec.ts`

**Complete CRUD operations for both normal and recurrent transactions**

- ✅ **Normal Transaction CRUD**: Create → Edit → Delete flow
- ✅ **Recurrent Transaction CRUD**: Create with recurrence → Edit → Surgical delete
- ✅ **Normal to Recurrent Conversion**: Edit existing transaction to become recurrent
- ✅ **Status Toggle Integration**: Verify status changes don't delete recurrent records
- ✅ **Complex Multi-Transaction Scenarios**: Mixed transaction types with various operations
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: Rapid CRUD operations timing

**Key Verifications:**

- Modal closure after successful operations
- Data persistence in table after edits
- Recurrence generation (multiple records created)
- Surgical deletion (only selected record removed)

### 2. `recurrence-comprehensive.spec.ts`

**Detailed recurrence functionality testing**

- 🔄 **Monthly Frequency**: Verify correct monthly record generation
- 🔄 **Multiple Frequencies**: Weekly, bi-weekly, quarterly recurrence patterns
- 🔄 **Normal to Recurrent Conversion**: Edit functionality to add recurrence
- 🔄 **Recurrent Modification**: Edit existing recurrent transactions
- 🔄 **Surgical Deletion**: Delete specific recurrent records without affecting others
- 🔄 **Status Toggle Safety**: Verify status changes don't delete other records
- 🔄 **Edge Cases**: Short/long recurrence periods and validation
- 🔄 **UI Feedback**: Preview text and occurrence counts
- 🔄 **Performance**: Large number of recurrent records handling
- 🔄 **Data Persistence**: Recurrence metadata survival across reloads

**Key Validations:**

- Record distribution across multiple months
- Recurrence metadata preservation
- Performance with high record counts
- UI feedback for occurrence predictions

### 3. `edit-functionality-fixed.spec.ts`

**Verification of the edit bug fixes we implemented**

- ✏️ **Normal Transaction Edit Fix**: Modal closes and data persists
- ✏️ **Recurrent Transaction Edit Fix**: Same fix applies to recurrent records
- ✏️ **Form Validation**: Error display and save blocking
- ✏️ **Multiple Independent Edits**: Each transaction edits correctly
- ✏️ **Category Changes**: All fields update properly during edit
- ✏️ **Status Preservation**: Status maintained during edits
- ✏️ **Cancel Functionality**: Discard changes and close modal
- ✏️ **Performance**: Rapid edit operations handling

**Bug Fixes Verified:**

- **CRITICAL BUG**: Edit modal staying open after save (FIXED ✅)
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Data not persisting after edit (FIXED ✅)
- Form validation blocking invalid saves
- Independent operation of multiple edits

### 4. `integration-scenarios.spec.ts`

**Real-world usage patterns and integration testing**

- 🔗 **Status Toggle Bug Fix**: Recurrent records not deleted when status changed
- 🔗 **Multiple Status Toggles**: Independent status changes
- 🔗 **Mixed Transaction Types**: Normal and recurrent transactions coexisting
- 🔗 **Filter Integration**: Filters working with recurrent data
- 🔗 **Month Grouping**: Records distributed correctly across months
- 🔗 **Data Persistence**: Survival through page reloads
- 🔗 **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of rapid operations
- 🔗 **Performance**: Large dataset operations
- 🔗 **Complex User Journey**: Real monthly budget scenario

**Integration Points Tested:**

- Filter system with recurrent data
- Month grouping and collapse/expand
- Status management across record types
- Data persistence and recovery

### 5. `validation-and-edge-cases.spec.ts`

**Comprehensive validation and edge case testing**

- 🧮 **Decimal Validation**: Valid/invalid decimal place handling
- 📝 **Form Validation**: Required fields and input constraints
- 📊 **Value Range Validation**: Min/max value enforcement
- 📝 **Description Validation**: Length and content validation
- 📅 **Date Validation**: Edge dates and leap year handling
- 🔄 **Recurrence Date Logic**: End date validation
- 🏷️ **Category Validation**: Auto-detection vs manual selection
- 🌐 **Browser Edge Cases**: Memory usage and local storage
- 📡 **Network Edge Cases**: Offline behavior simulation

**Critical Validations:**

- **Decimal Bug Fix**: Values like "R$ 1.246,29" now accepted (FIXED ✅)
- Range enforcement (min R$ 0,01, max R$ 999.999,99)
- Required field validation
- Date logic validation for recurrence

## Test Execution Strategy

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

```bash

## Key Bug Fixes Verified

### 1. Edit Functionality Bug (CRITICAL) ✅

**Problem**: Edit modal would stay open and data wouldn't persist
**Fix**: Synchronized `editForm` data with store's `editingRecord` before saving
**Tests**: `edit-functionality-fixed.spec.ts`

### 2. Status Toggle Deletion Bug (CRITICAL) ✅

**Problem**: Toggling status on recurrent records would delete all future records
**Fix**: Proper record identification in toggle functionality
**Tests**: `integration-scenarios.spec.ts`

### 3. Decimal Validation Bug ✅

**Problem**: Valid decimals like "R$ 1.246,29" were rejected
**Fix**: Improved floating-point precision handling in validation
**Tests**: `validation-and-edge-cases.spec.ts`

### 4. Recurrence Creation Bug ✅

**Problem**: Recurrent transactions weren't generating future records
**Fix**: Added recurrence processing to `handleValidatedCreate`
**Tests**: `recurrence-comprehensive.spec.ts`
