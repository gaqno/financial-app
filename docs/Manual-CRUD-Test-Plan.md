# 📋 Manual CRUD Test Plan - Financial Application

## 🎯 Test Objective

Validate all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations work correctly in real-world scenarios.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Add Multiple Records ✅ PASSED

**Goal**: Test adding different types of records

- ✅ Add Income Record: "Salary January" - R$ 50,00 (Receita)
- ✅ Add Expense Record: "Rent" - R$ 12,00 (Despesa)
- ✅ Add Another Expense: "Test Delete Fix" - R$ 5,00 (Despesa)
- ✅ Verify balance calculation: 50 - 12 - 5 = R$ 33,00

### Scenario 2: Delete Record ⚠️ PARTIAL - UI REACTIVITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Goal**: Test delete functionality with undo

- ✅ Delete "Test Delete Fix" record
- ✅ Verify delete modal appears
- ✅ Confirm deletion
- ✅ Verify undo toast appears
- ✅ **BACKEND**: Record removed from Pinia store correctly
- ❌ **FRONTEND**: Record still visible in UI during undo period
- ✅ Wait for undo to expire (5 seconds)
- ✅ **AFTER REFRESH**: Record permanently removed
- ✅ **AFTER REFRESH**: Balance updates: 50 - 12 = R$ 38,00

**🔍 ROOT CAUSE**: Vue reactivity not triggering for computed properties during undo period. Store data is correct, but UI doesn't update until page refresh.

### Scenario 3: Add Duplicate Records

**Goal**: Test adding similar/duplicate records

- ⏳ Add "Rent" - R$ 1200 (Despesa) again
- ⏳ Verify both rent records exist
- ⏳ Verify balance: 5000 - 1200 - 1200 = R$ 2600

### Scenario 4: Edit Record

**Goal**: Test edit functionality

- ⏳ Edit first "Rent" record to "Mortgage" - R$ 1500
- ⏳ Verify edit modal opens with correct data
- ⏳ Change description and value
- ⏳ Save changes
- ⏳ Verify changes are reflected
- ⏳ Verify balance updates: 5000 - 1500 - 1200 = R$ 2300

### Scenario 5: Status Toggle

**Goal**: Test status change functionality

- ⏳ Toggle "Salary January" from Pendente to Confirmado
- ⏳ Toggle "Mortgage" from Pendente to Confirmado
- ⏳ Verify status changes are reflected
- ⏳ Verify balance calculations remain correct

### Scenario 6: Filter Testing

**Goal**: Test filtering functionality

- ⏳ Filter by "Receitas" - should show only Salary
- ⏳ Filter by "Despesas" - should show Mortgage and Rent
- ⏳ Filter by "Todos" - should show all records

### Scenario 7: Complex Edit Test

**Goal**: Test editing with category and status changes

- ⏳ Edit "Salary January" to add category "💰 Renda"
- ⏳ Change status to "Confirmado"
- ⏳ Verify all changes are saved correctly

## 📊 Current State (After Partial Testing)

- **Records**:
  - Salary January: R$ 50,00 (Receita, Pendente, 📋 Outros)
  - Rent: R$ 12,00 (Despesa, Pendente, 📋 Outros)
- **Balance**: R$ 38,00 (after refresh)
- **Total Records**: 2 (after refresh)

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Delete UI Reactivity Bug ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem**: Records are correctly deleted from Pinia store but remain visible in the UI until page refresh.

**Technical Details**:

- ✅ Pinia store correctly removes record from `records.value` array
- ✅ localStorage is updated correctly
- ❌ Vue computed properties (`filteredData`, `groupedByMonth`, `saldoFinal`) not reactive to changes
- ❌ `triggerRef(records)` and `nextTick()` attempts don't resolve the issue

**Impact**: Poor user experience - users see deleted records until refresh

**Status**: Requires further Vue.js reactivity debugging

## ✅ Success Criteria Progress

- [x] Records can be added successfully
- [x] Delete functionality works at data level
- [ ] Delete functionality has proper UI reactivity ⚠️
- [ ] Edit functionality preserves data integrity
- [ ] Status toggles work correctly
- [ ] Filters work properly
- [x] Balance calculations are accurate (after refresh)
- [x] Data persists correctly after page refresh

## 🔧 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Delete UI Reactivity**: Investigate why Vue computed properties aren't updating
2. **Complete CRUD Testing**: Finish testing edit, status toggle, and filter scenarios
3. **Comprehensive E2E Tests**: Validate all workflows work end-to-end
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure app performance with larger datasets
